# SourceID-NMF
SourceID-NMF: Towards more accurate microbial source tracking via non-negative matrix factorization.
A major challenge of analyzing the compositional structure of microbiome data is identifying its potential origins. Here, we introduce a novel tool called SourceID-NMF for precise microbial source tracking. SourceID-NMF utilizes a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to trace the microbial sources contributing to a target sample, without relying on specific probability distributions.
